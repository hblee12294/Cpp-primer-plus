There is no denying that facts are necessary in dealing disciplines like history, politics, geography, etc.. This leads to many educational systems overemphasizing memorization of facts, such as statistics, names of people and places, formulas and so on. In my view, however, learning facts by rote pales compared with understanding of ideas and concepts.
